## Project Description

The focus of this project is data wrangling. The data used came from three sources: a flat csv file (downloaded from kaggle.com),
API (ComicVine API), and a website (marvel.com).
After the three sources have been cleaned and prepared, they were merged and loaded into an SQLite database. The data used in this project is mostly categorical.
